<a id="assistant-modes-discover-the-power-of-each-mode"></a>

## 🧠 Assistant Modes: Discover the power of each mode

InAppBot provides multiple modes that are tailored for different use cases, ensuring that you can offer the best user experience across various platforms and needs. Below are the available modes and their key features:

<a id="1-data-plus-mode"></a>        

#### 1. **Data Plus Mode**

<img src="lib/playground/onboarding/assets/images/dataplus_new.webp" alt="Data Plus Mode" width="50"/>

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Description
- **Type:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This mode is designed to enhance user interaction by incorporating additional knowledge through **PDF formats and web content**. When a user asks a question, the assistant first consults a **vector database** to retrieve relevant and specific context to inform the response. Based on this context, a deep learning language model (**LLM**) generates a personalized and detailed response.

What makes this process even more efficient is that the context retrieved from the vector database is refreshed with each query, eliminating the need to send all accumulated context to the LLM in every interaction. Instead, an advanced method is applied that allows the conversation to maintain coherence and continuity, even if the vector context from the previous question is not explicitly included in the next query to the LLM. This approach optimizes resource usage and ensures that responses remain relevant and consistent with the conversation’s flow without overloading the system with unnecessary information.

This strategy ensures that each response is not only informed by up-to-date and specific data but also maintains fluency and relevance throughout the entire user interaction, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of the assistant’s responses.

- **Response Speed:** Approximately **3 seconds** per response.
- **Costs:** The average cost is **$15** for every **50,000 messages** (including both questions and responses), based on using **2,000 tokens** per message.

#### Technologies
- **LLM:** Gemini 3.5 Flash, A state-of-the-art deep learning language model developed by Google, designed to deliver precise and contextually relevant responses.
- **Pinecone:** Vector database for efficient and rapid data storage and retrieval.
- **Firebase:** Secure and scalable mobile and web application development platform by Google.
- **Embedding Models:** Deep learning models that represent words, phrases, and documents as vectors, foundational for NLP tasks.
- **Knowledge Base:** Customizable integration of **PDF and web content**, enabling the assistant to respond with domain-specific information.

<img src="lib/playground/onboarding/assets/images/index.webp" alt="Index Mode" width="50"/>

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Description
- **Type:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

The **Index Mode** is specifically designed to optimize the retrieval and delivery of information within applications that require quick access to structured data. This mode functions by organizing and indexing content, allowing the virtual assistant to efficiently scan and retrieve the most relevant sections based on user queries.

**How Does It Work?**

- **Content Indexing:**
  - All relevant data and documents are indexed within the system, categorized into easily accessible segments, much like chapters in a book.
- **Efficient Retrieval:**
  - When a user asks a question, the assistant uses the indexed structure to scan for relevant segments, ensuring accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

- **Response Speed:** Approximately **3 seconds** per response.
- **Costs:** The average cost is **$15** for every **50,000 messages**, based on using **2,000 tokens** per message.

#### Technologies
- **LLM:** Gemini 3.5 Flash, Delivers precise and contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- **Firebase:** Backend for secure and efficient data management.
- **Knowledge Base:** Organized like a manual or a collection of books, where information is carefully curated, indexed, and structured for easy access.

#### Use Cases
- **Business Knowledge Management:**
  - Ideal for applications requiring quick and accurate responses based on indexed business data.
  - The assistant functions as a digital "book" of knowledge, manually fed with texts organized for precise retrieval.
- **Example of Use:**
  - Integrate business knowledge into the assistant with indices like **Contacts**.
  - If a user asks, "What is the company's email address?" the assistant consults the **Contacts** index to provide an accurate response.

<a id="why-were-building-inappbot"></a>
## 🌱 Why Were Building InApp.Bot


InApp.Bot began as a personal challenge to learn Flutter after a long break from programming. After 10 years without writing a line of code, I hired a freelancer to develop a car rental app for me. However, after more than a year of waiting with no progress, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I dived into learning Flutter, but soon realized that following tutorials wasn’t my style—I learn best by doing. 

That’s when I discovered the power of AI. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini became my mentors, explaining concepts and helping me write code. Within just one week, I had created an AI assistant for the project the freelancer had been working on. I was amazed at what I could achieve with the help of AI and poured all my free time into building this project.

As I continued, the AI assistants guided me, and I learned that a Flutter app could be embedded into native apps—something I hadn’t known before. Excited by this revelation, I shared my project in a Flutter community. I received 30 negative comments, but one stood out. It advised me to focus on scalability. After running the numbers, I realized my original project wasn’t scalable, so I abandoned it.

A few months later, I returned to the idea with a renewed focus: how to build a scalable AI assistant. This time, with the help of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, I was able to **finish the MVP of InApp.Bot**. Now, I want to collaborate with the community to create the **most advanced, open-source AI assistant** in existence. 

When I started, few major tech companies were integrating AI into their apps. Today, giants like Amazon, WhatsApp, and GitHub are leading the charge with their own assistants. The following GIFs show AI assistants embedded in these apps:

  <img src="doc/readme/gif/amazon.gif" alt="Amazon AI assistant" width="32%" />
  <img src="doc/readme/gif/whatsapp.gif" alt="WhatsApp AI assistant" width="32%" />
</p>

The time has come for all of us to have AI assistants in our projects. Together, we can build a future where these powerful tools are accessible to everyone. **InApp.Bot** isn’t just my project—it’s **our project**. Let’s create the most advanced assistant together, focusing on our personal projects while building **InApp.Bot assistants** to enhance your apps.

Let’s build something incredible—**open, scalable, and powered by the community**.
